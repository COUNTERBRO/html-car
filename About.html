    A sports car is a type of automobile designed to deliver superior speed, handling, and driving enjoyment. Typically low to the ground with a sleek, aerodynamic body, sports cars are built to prioritize performance over practicality. They often feature powerful engines, lightweight materials, and precision-tuned suspensions, enabling them to accelerate quickly, corner sharply, and provide a responsive, thrilling driving experience.

Most sports cars are two-seaters or 2+2 configurations (small rear seats), and are commonly available as coupes or convertibles. The drivetrain is often rear-wheel drive (RWD) for balanced handling, though many modern models also use all-wheel drive (AWD) for enhanced traction.

Whether powered by traditional internal combustion engines or modern electric motors, sports cars represent the fusion of engineering, technology, and styleâ€”built not just for transportation, but for the pure joy of driving.
